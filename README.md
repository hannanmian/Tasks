# Data Science Internship  

This repository contains the solutions for my Data Science Internship tasks.  
Each task demonstrates a different concept in data analysis and machine learning.  

---

## 📊 Task 1 – Titanic EDA and Visualization  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`).  
- Cleaned missing values, explored survival distribution, and studied age patterns.  
- Created visualizations such as:  
  - Survival counts (bar chart)  
  - Age distribution (histogram)  
  - Feature correlation (heatmap)  
- **Key Outcome:** Discovered important survival patterns (e.g., women and children had higher survival rates).

## 📝 Task 2 – Sentiment Analysis  
- Built a sentiment classification model using a custom IMDB-like dataset (`imdb_1000_reviews.csv`).  
- Steps included:  
  - Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation/stopword removal).  
  - Converting text into features using **CountVectorizer**.  
  - Training a **Logistic Regression** classifier.  
  - Evaluating model accuracy and testing on new reviews.  
- **Key Outcome:** Successfully classified reviews as **positive** or **negative**.

## 💳 Task 3 – Fraud Detection  
- Created a fraud detection model on a small transaction dataset (`fraud_dataset.csv`).  
- Balanced the dataset using **undersampling**.  
- Trained a **Random Forest** classifier.  
- Evaluated accuracy and tested predictions on example transactions.  
- **Key Outcome:** Model can identify fraudulent vs. normal transactions with good accuracy.

## 🏠 Task 4 – House Price Prediction  
- Used the **Boston Housing dataset** (`housing.csv`) to predict house prices.  
- Preprocessing included normalization of features.  
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model.  
- Evaluated performance with **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  
- **Key Outcome:** Built a regression model that can estimate housing prices from given features.
