## 📝 Task 2 – Sentiment Analysis  
**Objective:** Build a sentiment classification model using IMDB-like reviews (`imdb_1000_reviews.csv`).  

✔️ Text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing punctuation & stopwords)  
✔️ Feature extraction with **CountVectorizer**  
✔️ Model training with **Logistic Regression**  
✔️ Accuracy evaluation & sample predictions  



---

## 💳 Task 3 – Fraud Detection  
**Objective:** Detect fraudulent transactions using (`fraud_dataset.csv`).  

✔️ Balanced dataset using undersampling (fraud vs normal)  
✔️ Model training with **Random Forest Classifier**  
✔️ Accuracy evaluation  
✔️ Fraud prediction on sample transactions
